Welcome to my personal site! I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, studying computer science. My research interest is in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on healthcare applications. I am advised by Professors [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/)
 and [Jimeng Sun](http://www.sunlab.org/) and working currently on representation learning for text, more specifically incorporating medical ontological/structural information into clinical note representations using deep learning, as well as unsupervised learning methods for generating embeddings constrained by hierarchical lexical semantic properties.
 
My interests within NLP are broad, but include machine reading, hierarchical representations of text, temporal modeling, and text generation/summarization.
