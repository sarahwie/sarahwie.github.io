Welcome to my personal site! I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, studying computer science. My research interest is in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on healthcare applications. I am advised by Professor [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/), and working currently on representation learning for text, more specifically incorporating medical ontological/structural information into clinical note representations using deep learning, as well as unsupervised learning methods for generating embeddings constrained by hierarchical lexical semantic properties.
 
My interests within NLP and machine learning are broad, but include machine reading, hierarchical representations of text, temporal modeling, and text generation/summarization.

### Updates
- **Spring 2019:** I will be joining the Medical Records team at Google Brain this summer as a research intern.
- **Summer 2018:** I was an intern at Sutter Health in Walnut Creek, CA working with the Research, Development and Dissemination Team on deep learning models for outcome prediction using text. 
- **Summer 2018:** Attended NAACL in New Orleans.
- **Spring 2018:** Paper accepted to NAACL 2018 ([Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes from Clinical Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05695.pdf))
- **Spring 2018:** Attended the CRA-W Graduate Cohort Workshop for Women in San Francisco, CA.
