Welcome to my personal site! I am a fourth-year computer science PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [Mark Reidl](https://eilab-gt.github.io). 

My research interest is interpretability methods for deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP). This encompasses three threads: 
- defining and standardizing terminology, desiderata, and evaluation methods;
- understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing models within this framework; and
- designing architectures which address these weaknesses.
