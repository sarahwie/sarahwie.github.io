# How to Contact Me

If you have a **question about my research or papers** or if your request does not fall into the below categories, you are always welcome to email me.

# Information for Interested Students

If you are **interested in doing research**:

If you are a **current student** in a full-time PhD, Masters, or undergraduate program at UMD, please add the heading "[Current Student]" to your email.

If you are a **prospective student**, I plan to admit 1-2 PhD students in computer science in the coming (fall 2026 start) cycle. Please apply by the December deadline and mention my name in your application. Please also note that you may be able to get an application fee waiver, but that can take some time, so I recommend requesting it if you are eligible ahead of the application deadline.

# Q & A

### Will you be accepting PhD students for fall 2026? 

Yes; 1-2. Please apply to the Computer Science PhD program by the December deadline and mention my name in your application. Please also note that you may be able to get an application fee waiver, but that can take some time, so I recommend requesting it if you are eligible ahead of the deadline. You may email me once with the header "[Prospective Student]", but unfortunately I generally do not have time to read and respond to these emails.

### Do you have opportunities for undergraduates or masters students in your lab?

Yes; a limited amount. 

### Are you looking for external collaborators or interns? 

I am always open to exciting collaborations, but I have limited bandwidth currently so I will consider these on a case-by-case basis. I currently do not have funding to accept interns or visitors in my group.

### What am I looking for when working with students? 


### What am I like as an advisor? 



### I am a UMD undergrad. Can I have permission to enroll in your seminar? 

The course is primarily designed for graduate students doing ML/NLP research. It will revolve around student presentations and group discussion of cutting-edge research papers, and thus requires a deep familiarity with Transformer architectures and the current standard NLP training and inference methods. The undergraduate prerequisites are CMSC470 Intro to NLP and one or more of {CMSC421 Intro to AI, CMSC422 Intro to ML, CMSC472 Intro to Deep Learning} or equivalent courses. Alternatively, if you have done ML or NLP research with a professor in the department, that can qualify in lieu of the courses. If this applies to you, please email me with your transcript and a brief description of any relevant research experience.
