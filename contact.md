# How to Contact Me

If you have a **question about my research or papers** or if your request does not fall into the below categories, please email me!
I [sometimes take up to 1-2 weeks to respond](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02381-x.pdf) and do appreciate a reminder email if I have not responded within a week. If your request is more urgent, please include "[Urgent]" in the subject line.

# Information for Interested Students

If you are **interested in doing research** with me, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/cBdPbjnsp6KENGsdA). I will next look at the responses on **Monday, September 1st** for the fall semester.

If you are a **current student** in a full-time PhD, Masters, or undergraduate program at UMD, filling out the above form is sufficient for expressing research interest. If you wish to email me for some other reason, please add the heading "[Current Student]" to your email.

If you are a **prospective student**, I plan to admit 1-2 PhD students in the coming (fall 2026 start) cycle. Please apply to the Computer Science PhD program by the December 2025 deadline and mention my name in your application. Please also note that you may be able to get an application fee waiver, but that can take some time, so I recommend requesting it if you are eligible ahead of the application deadline. You may email me once with the header "[Prospective Student]", but unfortunately I almost never have time to read and respond to these emails.

# Q & A

Please also note that you may be able to get an application fee waiver, but that can take some time, so I recommend requesting it if you are eligible ahead of the deadline. You may email me once with the header "[Prospective Student]", but unfortunately I generally do not have time to read and respond to these emails. -->

Yes; please fill out the [form](https://forms.gle/cBdPbjnsp6KENGsdA).
