Welcome to my personal site! I am a third-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, studying computer science. My research interest is in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on healthcare applications. 
 
My interests within NLP and machine learning are broad, but include machine reading, hierarchical representations of text, temporal modeling, and text generation/summarization.
