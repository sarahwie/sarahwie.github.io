Welcome to my personal site! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) (Ai2). I am also a member of [H2Lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. I am advised by [Ashish Sabharwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VspfeAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/). I received my PhD from Georgia Tech in 2022, advised by Prof. [Mark Riedl](https://eilab-gt.github.io). During my PhD I spent time interning at Google, Sutter Health, and Ai2 (2x), and won the Ai2 Outstanding Intern award.

I work on the **interpretability and transparency of language models (LMs)** and other neural networks, with the goal of increasing their reliability, safety, and performance. I also focus on providing natural language explanations for users of LMs.

**I am on the academic job market for the 2024-2025 cycle! Please reach out if you believe I would be a good fit.**

### [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/website_cv.pdf) (last updated 02/17/25)
### [Research Statement]({{ site.url }}/assets/wiegreffe_research_2.pdf)
### [Short Bio]({{ site.url }}/assets/bio.txt)

<!-- I am recruiting interns to work with me at AI2. The application is always rolling, but please [apply here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/thealleninstitute/jobs/2171324) by Nov. 1st for summer 2023 consideration! (Please also mention me in your application.) -->

<!-- My research interest is interpretability methods for deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP). This encompasses three threads: 
- defining and standardizing terminology, desiderata, and evaluation methods;
- understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing models within this framework; and
- designing architectures which address these weaknesses. -->
