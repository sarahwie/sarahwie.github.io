Welcome to my personal site! I am a fourth-year computer science PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. [Mark Reidl](http://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl). My research interest is in natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on interpretability, fairness and robustness.

**I am looking for funded summer research opportunities in NLP + interpretability.**
