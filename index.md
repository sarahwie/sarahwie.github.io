Welcome to my personal site! I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, studying computer science. My research interest is natural language processing, and more broadly machine learning with applications in healthcare and social computing. I am advised by Drs. [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/)
 and [Jimeng Sun](http://www.sunlab.org/) and working on information extraction/text representations for clinical notes using deep learning. 
 
 My interests in natural language processing are broad, but include machine reading, hierarchical representations for information extraction, text generation, and summarization.
