Welcome to my personal site! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), or AI2 for short, working on the [Aristo](https://allenai.org/aristo) team. I am also affiliated with Prof. [Hanna Hajishirzi's group](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.
I received my PhD from Georgia Tech in 2022, advised by Prof. [Mark Riedl](https://eilab-gt.github.io).

<!-- I am recruiting interns to work with me at AI2. The application is always rolling, but please [apply here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/thealleninstitute/jobs/2171324) by Nov. 1st for summer 2023 consideration! (Please also mention me in your application.) -->

My research interest is interpretability methods for deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP). This encompasses three threads: 
- defining and standardizing terminology, desiderata, and evaluation methods;
- understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing models within this framework; and
- designing architectures which address these weaknesses.
