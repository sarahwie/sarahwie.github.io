Welcome to my personal site! I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, studying computer science. My research interest is in natural language processing and machine learning, with an interest in healthcare applications. I am advised by Professors [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/)
 and [Jimeng Sun](http://www.sunlab.org/) and working currently on representation learning for text, more specifically incorporating medical ontological/structural information into clinical note representations using deep learning, as well as unsupervised learning methods for generating embeddings constrainted by hierarchical lexical semantic properties from Wordnet.
 
 My interests in natural language processing are broad, but include machine reading, hierarchical representations for information extraction, and text generation/summarization.
